Description
===========
This CircuitPython driver simulates a *really big* USB HID joystick device - up
to 8 axes, 128 buttons and 4 hat (POV) switches.  If you want to build a custom
game controller with a lot of inputs - *I'm looking at you, space/flight sim
pilots, racing sim drivers and virtual farmers* - JoystickXL can help.


Requirements
============
*This driver relies on features that were introduced in CircuitPython
version 7.x*  **You must be running CircuitPython 7.0.0 or newer
on your device in order to use JoystickXL.**

* This driver was made for devices running `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython>`_.
  For a list of compatible devices, see `circuitpython.org <https://circuitpython.org/downloads>`_.

* There are no dependencies on any other CircuitPython drivers, libraries or modules.

* Pre-compiled (``.mpy``) versions of JoystickXL are available in the `releases <https://github.com/fasteddy516/CircuitPython_JoystickXL/releases>`_
  section for CircuitPython versions 8.x and 9.x.  


Limitations
===========
* A wired USB connection to the host device is required.  *Bluetooth
  connectivity is not supported at this time.*

* Axis data is reported with 8-bit resolution (values ranging from 0-255).

* Only one JoystickXL device can be defined per CircuitPython board.  *You
  cannot have a single board report as two or more independant joysticks.*

* JoystickXL's reporting frequency - thus, input latency - is affected by
  many factors, including processor speed, the number of inputs that need
  to be processed, and the latency of any external input peripherals that
  are being used.  The reporting frequency is going to be significantly
  higher on a Metro M4 Express using on-board GPIO than it is on a QT-PY
  using I2C/SPI-based I/O expanders. 
  

Host OS/Software Compatibility
==============================
On **Windows 10/11**, all 8 axes 128 buttons and 4 hat switches are supported at
the operating system level, and JoystickXL has been tested and confirmed to work
with the following games:

* **Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020)** *(All inputs)*
* **Elite Dangerous** *(Limited to 32 buttons)*
* **Star Citizen** *(All inputs)*
* **Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) World** *(All inputs)*
* **EverSpace 2** *(All inputs - hat switches are considered to be axes)*
* **Forza Horizon 4** *(All inputs)*
* **BeamNG.drive** *(Limited to 7 axes and 1 hat switch)*
* **Farming Simulator 19** *(Limited to 7 axes, 24 buttons and 1 hat switch)*

*Note that any game-specific input limitations mentioned above are - to the
best of my knowledge - a result of the game's joystick implementation, and are
not unique to JoystickXL.*

On **Linux**, a very limited amount of testing has been done on a Raspberry Pi
4B using ``jstest`` (part of the ``joystick`` package).  The first 7 axes and
80 buttons work correctly.  Axis 8 does not register any events, nor do any
buttons beyond the first 80.  Only a single hat switch *sort of* works, but it
gets interpreted as two axes rather than an actual hat switch.  Other Linux
platforms/distributions/applications have not been tested.

No testing has been done on an **Apple/Mac** platform.


Documentation
=============
Full documentation is available at `<https://circuitpython-joystickxl.readthedocs.org>`_.


Installation
============
1. Download the `latest release of JoystickXL <https://github.com/fasteddy516/CircuitPython_JoystickXL/releases/latest>`_
   that corresponds to the version of CircuitPython you're running.  (i.e.
   ``joystick_xl_x.x.x_cp8`` for CircuitPython 8.x)
2. Extract the files from the downloaded .zip archive.
3. Copy the ``joystick_xl`` folder to the ``lib`` folder on your device's
   ``CIRCUITPY`` drive.

For additional information on installing libraries, see Adafruit's
`Welcome to CircuitPython Guide <https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries>`_.


Using JoystickXL
================
1. Create/modify ``boot.py`` on your CircuitPython device to enable the
   required custom USB HID device.

   .. code:: python

      """boot.py"""
      import usb_hid
      from joystick_xl.hid import create_joystick

      # enable default CircuitPython USB HID devices as well as JoystickXL
      usb_hid.enable(
        (
          usb_hid.Device.KEYBOARD,
          usb_hid.Device.MOUSE,
          usb_hid.Device.CONSUMER_CONTROL,
          create_joystick(axes=2, buttons=2, hats=1),
        )
      )

2. Use JoystickXL in ``code.py`` like this:

   .. code:: python
     
      """code.py"""
      import board
      from joystick_xl.inputs import Axis, Button, Hat
      from joystick_xl.joystick import Joystick
   
      js = Joystick()
   
      js.add_input(
          Button(board.D9),
          Button(board.D10),
          Axis(board.A2),
          Axis(board.A3),
          Hat(up=board.D2, down=board.D3, left=board.D4, right=board.D7),
      )

      while True:
          js.update()

   See the `examples <https://circuitpython-joystickxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_
   and `API documentation <https://circuitpython-joystickxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_
   for more information.


Testing JoystickXL Devices
==========================
Not all platforms/games/applications support joystick devices with high input
counts.  **Before you spend any time writing code or building hardware for a
custom controller, you should make sure the software that you want to use it
with is compatible.**

Fortunately, JoystickXL has a built-in testing module that can be run right
from the CircuitPython Serial Console/REPL to verify compatibility with an
operating system, game or application - *no input wiring or code.py required!*

See the
`compatibility and testing documentation <https://circuitpython-joystickxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start.html#verifying-compatibility>`_
for more information.

`Tutorial about USB HID Report Descriptors <https://eleccelerator.com/tutorial-about-usb-hid-report-descriptors/>`_
was the starting point for my journey into USB HID land.

The tools and documentation provided by the `USB Implementors Forum <https://www.usb.org/>`_
were an excellent resource, especially in regards to the creation of the
required USB HID descriptor.  The following resources were particularly useful:

* `HID Descriptor Tool <https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-descriptor-tool>`_
